The other day, I suddenly had an idea that struck me and I thought I would like to
turn this idea into a game. So the game I want to make next is this. It is bascially a game about making choices and how sometimes
we do not obey the choices we make. I was thinking about how people always go back on their words when they promise to something
and I thought why not make a game about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea of the game is simple, it will start with a yes/no choice question. For example, do you like candies? If the player
answers yes, I will present a scenario that player will have to throw the candies away rather than keeping them and likewise for the
other choice. This way, when the game ends, I will show remind the player that the (original) choice they had make and the (actual) choice
that they executed is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to show people that people usually promise things and not follow through. We are always fickle minded and we don't always
know what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the game idea for now. Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://0xfe11.github.io/posts/choices-an-idea-for-a-new-game/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2017 03:44:57 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

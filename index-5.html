    <div><p>Packt have been having this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.packtpub.com/free-learning">Free Learning</a> for a couple of years now. Everyday Packt will release a free ebook to get for 24 hours.
Personally I have accumulated quite a number of free books that way from them which is stored in their library under my account. I thought it
would be interesting to download (most of) them to my local libray so that I can put it into my device to read.</p>
<p>Packt do provide the links to the books that I have downloaded and they have a download button to download the book one by one. I don't
have the luxury of time to download one by one, hence I decided to automate this process.</p>
<p>Some disclaimer before I begin, this method is for downloading the books that are released via Free Learning and owned by you. As seen in
the picture below.</p>
<img alt="/images/downloading-free-books-from-packt_0.png" src="/images/downloading-free-books-from-packt_0.png">
<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Packt actually supports downloading the resource from their server. From this we know that we can find out if there is an embed url in the
page or find out if it is calling a REST api to get the files. For this, I decided to use the web browser's built
in network inspector and look at the network tab to see what is happening behind the scenes. I have clicked on the download mobi button and
from the network tab, there is several calls to the backend. I am only interested in looking the xhr request that the webpage is sending.</p>
<img alt="/images/downloading-free-books-from-packt_1.png" src="/images/downloading-free-books-from-packt_1.png">
<p>The API of interest here is the following, we can get all the APIs by clicking on all the download buttons.</p>
<pre class="code html"><a name="rest_code_8451436a0c654389939d12defbce6cb2-1"></a>[GET] /products-v1/products/1234567890123/files/mobi
<a name="rest_code_8451436a0c654389939d12defbce6cb2-2"></a>[GET] /products-v1/products/1234567890123/files/epub
<a name="rest_code_8451436a0c654389939d12defbce6cb2-3"></a>[GET] /products-v1/products/1234567890123/files/pdf
<a name="rest_code_8451436a0c654389939d12defbce6cb2-4"></a>[GET] /products-v1/products/1234567890123/files/code
</pre><p>Here we see the 1234567890123 which is our product id, (I have obfuscate the product id for privacy purpose). The product id is a unique string
of integers which is tagged to a title.</p>
<p>In the requests to the download API, we can see the usual stuff in a http request header with an additional field named Authorization which
is a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) used to authenticate ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-the-jwt">
<h2>Getting the JWT</h2>
<p>Now that we have the APIs to download one individual file, we will need to find a way to get the JWT token. Taking a step back, I went back
to the login page for Packt and look at the network calls made. I found the following call to generate the token,</p>
<pre class="code html"><a name="rest_code_fabe2de86b3c40c0bf3b374cd8d2275a-1"></a>[POST] /auth-v1/users/tokens
<a name="rest_code_fabe2de86b3c40c0bf3b374cd8d2275a-2"></a>{
<a name="rest_code_fabe2de86b3c40c0bf3b374cd8d2275a-3"></a>  "username": "",
<a name="rest_code_fabe2de86b3c40c0bf3b374cd8d2275a-4"></a>  "password": ""
<a name="rest_code_fabe2de86b3c40c0bf3b374cd8d2275a-5"></a>}
</pre><p>This will give us the Authorization token that we will need for the download APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-the-list-of-files">
<h2>Getting the list of files</h2>
<p>Once again, with my network tab opened, I navigate around the website and I found out that when I clicked on my owned products, there will be
a REST call to the server to get my owned products. The parameters allow me to fetch up to a certain amount of books.</p>
<pre class="code html"><a name="rest_code_6416636bea2e45dca7e98e8c0e1a0c7a-1"></a>[GET] /entitlements-v1/users/me/products?sort=createdAt:DESC<span class="err">&amp;</span>offset=0<span class="err">&amp;</span>limit=10
</pre><p>The result is a json array with the product name, id, metadata etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-the-api-with-insomnia">
<h2>Testing the API with Insomnia</h2>
<p>For most of my discovery, I am using the browser's network inspector tool and Insomnia for testing of the REST APIs. Some of the steps for
testing are,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Getting our JWT with the tokens API.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting the list of the books.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the JWT from 1. we can randomly use a product id from 2. to test any of the download APIs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once I am satisfied with this step, I can move on to the next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-the-python-script-to-get-em-all">
<h2>Writing the Python script to get 'em' all</h2>
<p>Initially I have written the code using requests library, however I realized that downloading file serially is very slow and hence I written
a second async version to handle bulk downloading. The non-async version supports for downloading individual books while the async version is
for downloading of all the books. The code is rather buggy, I might improve it in the future if there is a need. The code can be found here on
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/0xfe11/packt_downloader">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <div><p>Few days ago, I came across a git tutorial on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBg9mlpzEYU">YouTube</a> by Scott Hanselman. I strongly encourage people to take a look even if you are
proficient enough with git. In his videos, he already did not start right into the git commands but rather he started by introducing the
powerline tools for Windows so that you can improve your workflow. In the past, I just use the vanilla Windows Terminal with powershell
however after reading through his <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToMakeAPrettyPromptInWindowsTerminalWithPowerlineNerdFontsCascadiaCodeWSLAndOhmyposh.aspx">blog</a>, I think it is actually quite easy to set it up.</p>
<p>I will go through the steps to have your own powerline in Windows Terminal as well as some of the customization I did.</p>
<div class="section" id="getting-windows-terminal">
<h2>Getting Windows Terminal</h2>
<p>I just downloaded it from my Microsoft Windows Store so that is will be automatically updated to stable. Feel free to install it anyway you
like.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-oh-my-posh">
<h2>Installing oh-my-posh</h2>
<p>Following the instructions on the oh-my-posh <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">github</a>, do the following command in your Windows Terminal (PowerShell).</p>
<pre class="code powershell"><a name="rest_code_c09a6947896d48419d0c609faa481b51-1"></a><span class="nb">Install-Module</span> <span class="n">posh-git</span> <span class="n">-Scope</span> <span class="n">CurrentUser</span>

</pre><p>It will prompt you if you want to trust the third-party and install their software, go ahead and press Y to accept.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-oh-my-posh">
<h2>Setting up oh-my-posh</h2>
<p>Next step, we will create a new PowerShell profile (similar to a .bashrc)</p>

<div class="section" id="setting-nerd-fonts">
<h2>Setting Nerd Fonts</h2>
<p>Now when you open your Windows Terminal, you might notice some of your fonts are boxes, that is because it will be looking for some of the
glyphs that will not be included in your standard fonts. Head on over to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/">NERD FONTS</a> and find some fonts that you like. Personally I went
ahead with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads">FiraCode Nerd Font</a>. I went ahead and extracted the whole folder, based on the fonts you like, you might install all of them.
Do note that some fonts are stated as Windows Compatible and I just went with those. Just right click on the font that you want on your
file explorer and click on Install.</p>
<p>After installing the font, open Windows Terminal and then open the settings (click the down arrow -&gt; settings or press Ctrl+,), this will open
up an editor (Visual Studio for my case) and you can add the following to your settings.json file.</p>
<pre class="code json"><a name="rest_code_23711a7d81e04ec4b0bcb59afcb4fac8-1"></a><span class="nt">"fontFace"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"FiraCode NF"</span>

    <div><p>Seriously why are web browser using so much memory nowadays, how much ram do I need before my web browser run out of memory to operate. I am
running Firefox browser v77.0.1 (latest stable). I have in the browser 15 opened tabs, some of them pinned (like my messengers) and memory
usage is about 1GB?!? On my current machine, I have a 8GB ram initially but I realized after some light web surfing and usage, the memory
usage climb to about full utilization. Seriously what is my web browser doing?! Ended up I had to upgrade my ram so that I can open more tabs.
I will try to see if it is something wrong with firefox, maybe it is time for a refresh.</p>
<p>Or maybe it is time to switch to something else entirely. Seriously I dislike the bloat that is the web. It is filled with javascript that is
really slow to execute and on top of that, those ads filled piece of malware on most website is really making my computer doing unnecessary work.
I hope we can use the web without all this bloat. I wish there is something I can do about it.</p>

    <div><p>Last time on the blog, I mentioned that I was trying out Arch Linux distro again. I guess I was
partially inspired by people who are using tiling managers and also I was looking for something
lightweight for my old machines. About a week after the blog post, I actually installed Void (again)
on my machine.</p>
<p>In fact the reason why I like Void was because it is a new distro that is not based off any
distribution as well. Personally I dislike the fact that there is a reliance on an upstream. To be
honest I would have stayed with Void. I really like the fast boot up and I got wifi running, the most
important thing for my laptop as well as setting up the desktop/browser for my daily usage.</p>
<p>It was at this point of time I came across a post on Hacker News about installation of FreeBSD on
a ThinkPad that got me thinking about trying FreeBSD again. For the observant, yes, this is not
my first installation of FreeBSD, I think I might have attempted to install on my thinkpad in
fact. It was very long ago. I remember seeing the screenshots of a KDE environment running in the
distrowatch page and I thought to myself, does it become that after installation. I think I went
ahead to install but to my disappoinment it was just CLI. Note: At that point of time, I was only
comfortable with gui installers and graphical interfaces. I didn't really do much on the cli.</p>
<p>Now that I was more comfortable with a installation of Arch/Void, I decided to give FreeBSD another
go. The article detailed some of the packages and settings he have done, which are quite useful.</p>
<p>Right now I have two old and spare computers lying around which I have installed FreeBSD and NetBSD
on both of them. I also wanted to try OpenBSD however the lack of wifi drivers in the install media
is not making it easy for me to install, hence I would leave that to another day.</p>
<p>BSD till next time. Stay tuned as I update my experience with my BSDs.</p></div>

    <div><p>This post is about my new Arch set-up on my old Lenovo laptop. Okay this is not exactly a new Arch set-up because I
have installed Arch once before many years ago. I was interested in a Linux installation where it is just barebones
enough for me to get it up and running without having to deal with building from source or missing drivers.</p>
<p>I have also been using Manjaro on and off for some time. I really like the distro very much and it is based off Arch
as well. Prior to this build, I was playing around with AntiX. I think it is quite user friendly however I think I
prefer rolling release for my Linux and I really like Arch as a distro.</p>
<p>So what's new in this build, you might ask? Like I mentioned, I have used Linux on and off for the past many years but
somehow, it didn't really stick to me. I feel like there is too much customization and tweaks that can be done. All these
makes my learning slope a bit steeper. On and off, I have been trying tiling managers, editors and nothing sticks until
this build.</p>
<p>Anyways I have put together a useable stack that I deem worthy to work in and I would like to share what it is. There are
various Youtube channels that I follow that discuss these ideas and it is these ideas that set me forth on my journey
to build something I would enjoy working in.</p>
<p>Firstly, the hardware is a (very old) Lenovo Thinkpad from 2009. I am really impressed with Lenovo, good job there. I
install the latest Arch Linux from USB drive. I had to reboot the distro from my USB a few times because I didn't
install some of the driver for my WiFi card. Luckily this was as easy as booting off the USB and chrooting into my
machine and installing those packages all thanks to an Arch install guide I <a class="reference external" href="https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/">found</a>.</p>
<p>After the WiFi packages got installed, the next thing to do was to set up a desktop environment for my usage. I wanted
to give myself another shot at a tiling manager. There are people who are against the idea of a tiling manager and
people who like the idea. Personally I think choosing the right tool for the job is more important. I would like to
give tiling manager another go. Before I set up the tiling manager, I would need to install Xorg and set it up.</p>
<p>I make a copy of the .xinitrc file and added some configuration of my own, namely using xrandr to turn off my primary
monitor, as it is busted and I am using an external monitor. After that I added the lines to run the respective tiling
manager.</p>
<p>On my list right now, I have a few that I want to try. I installed all of them and I give them a go. The following are
the ones I have tried, Awesome, dwm, herbstluftwm, i3, spectrwm (somehow crashed upon run). I really like dwm as
the config seems to be easiest. Awesome's configuration seems to be very flexible as it is lua based.</p>
<p>Interestingly I went with <a class="reference external" href="https://herbstluftwm.org/">herbstluftwm</a>. Honestly I have not heard of this manager and initially it was not as good.
In fact, I feel that the whole usage is very intuitive.</p>
<p>On top of that I have installed the following,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> - Shell</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/naelstrof/maim">maim</a> - Taking screenshot</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> - Editing</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://qutebrowser.org/">Qutebrowser</a> - Web browser</p></li>
<li><p>(suckless) <a class="reference external" href="https://st.suckless.org/">Simple Terminal</a> - Terminal Emulator</p></li>
</ul>
<p>for my daily usage. I will add on more stuff as I need.</p>
<p>As for managing my dot files, I found a few solutions online. In the end, I went with the GNU Stow approach to managing
my dotfiles. It is actually very simple to set-up. The article to set-up can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Showing off my current build.</p>

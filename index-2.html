    <div><p>Recently, I was given a task to use only C++ and Gmail API to fetch emails, so I decided to go ahead and use the SDK provided by Google. This client api is really dated and if you go onto Google's developer documentation, there is not much information about how to use the sdk.</p>
<p>Getting the sdk to work is really not a walk in the park. There are several problems that I faced when building the library. Firstly, there is not much information on how to use the sdk and luckily there is a calendar sample that demonstrate how to use the api espcially the authentication part of Google which requires the use of OAuth 2.0.</p>
<p>To start using the Google client api library, we first need to create a <a class="reference external" href="https://console.developers.google.com/">project</a>, next we have to download the secrets that can be used for the application. When I was doing the task, I was stuck on the OAuth part for quite some time. It turns out, I was using the same OAuth store that the Calendar sample was using and thus I could not authenticate my account.</p>
<p>After I got that to work, I am ready to download some emails from Gmail. I followed the sample given by the calendar sample and tried to use the similar functionality. Initially I tried to use the similar method to download the email, but I got no results. And also, while I was trying to download email, I encountered an issue with undefined symbols. Upon further inspection, I realized that Google api generators for C++ does not generate the proper code for the Gmail api and this result in partial code. Luckily this are easy to fix as the functionality are similar to some of the implemented functionality.</p>
<p>Fixing that, I thought everything is going smoothly and I tried to download some emails. It is here that I ran into some issues with the client giving me some error. Initially I thought it was my code that was giving me issue. This took some time for me to resolve until I came across this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/issues/41">issue</a> which lead me to check the code generated by the api generator. It is there that I realized that the function signature is wrong for the gmail service which takes in StringPiece instead of string and this causes the function to not be overridden properly.</p>
<p>Fixing this is also quite trivial, just change the function signatures. If anybody is interested in getting it to work, feel free to get the code here on <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/zgoh/Mail_Fetcher">gitlab</a>.</p></div>

    <div><p>2017 have been an interesting year for myself, it is the first time that I considered doing something other than games. In the past, I always thought that I would graduate and be involved in a game company. However in recent months, I have been exposed to building softwares that are not related to video games and I really enjoyed myself building these applications that I have considered to devote myself to building software instead of video games after I graduate.</p>
<p>In these past few months, I am interning as a software developer. My primary role includes building web backend for them using technologies like flask, mySQL, MongoDB. Apart from them, I am also exposed to a machine learning project that is undergoing where we learnt and used SciKit-Learn to implement a model.</p>
<p>Recently, I went for an interview and I was given a task to do. The task include using Gmail API to get mail and download and encrypt the mail onto the folder. I decided to go with the Google C++ client API which is dated and a pain to get it to work. I will discuss about how to get it to work.</p></div>

    <div><p>This is actually my second 3D game that I have helped to develop. Now that the game is done, I wanted to quickly write down my thoughts
on what went wrong and areas of improvement as well as the things that went smoothly for the project. Following that I would also like
to share my future plans.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-went-wrong">
<h2>What went wrong?</h2>
<div class="section" id="lack-of-communications-and-vision">
<h3>1. Lack of communications and vision.</h3>
<p>The main issue that I had when developing for The Last Defender (TLD) is that we do not have a clear vision of what we want to achieve. Most
of the time, we do not know what we want and we merely implement the stuff based on what we feel is needed for the game. This in turn made the
game went in all sorts of directions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="poor-engine-architecture">
<h3>2. Poor engine architecture.</h3>
<p>A lot of our development time were spent on fixing bugs. I believed that were having memory bugs because it would caused random crash from time to time.
I think that this late into the development, we should be spending more time churning out newer contents and rather than that, most of our time were spent
fixing engine bugs which caused our gameplay logic to be very fragile. It crashed really easily and sometimes we had no idea where was causing to crash.</p>
<p>One such area where we believed were having issues were the tween system. The tween system initially keeps reference to objects, meaning that when the items
dies, it will still be holding the reference to these items and potentially modiyfing memory. The fix was to recreate the tween front end to take in handles
instead of the reference to the objects. These took a little while to get used to and eventually, all of the system was using it. This fixed some of our
issues that we were having.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="losing-motivations">
<h3>3. Losing motivations.</h3>
<p>Several times during the span of the project, I was not really motivated to continue the project. I would rather focus on my other assignments than work
on the game. Reason because that I feel that this was not a game that I would enjoy playing much. This made me realized that it is tough to work as a game
developer if I cannot enjoy the game. I think I still want to make games, but perhaps not for a big studio, I want to make something that I enjoy making.</p>
<p>Apart from me, I can tell some of my team mates have like really low morale when it comes to the game. We have weekly meetings and standups but I feel that
rather than serving its purpose of informing what others are doing, I feel that it is more of a chore. I think it might be because of the way it is organized.
I think team meetings is where team mates come together and show each other what they have done. Rather than talking about it, it's better to show others
what you have been working on.</p>
<p>That being said, I am going to try my hands on being an app developer for a while. Did I mention, I currently found an internship position at an NUS
lab/startup. They are making apps that will benefit people and I want to try my hands on working on apps rather than games for a little while.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-went-right">
<h2>What went right?</h2>
<div class="section" id="able-to-make-assets-even-without-artists">
<h3>1. Able to make assets even without artists.</h3>
<p>Most important thing in games is always about creating assets. Unfortunately for us, our artists left during the start of the semester and therefore we
had to rely on our own to create our own 2D/3D art assets. Additionally, we also had an additional external member help with the sound design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="juicy-particles-and-feedbacks">
<h3>2. Juicy particles and feedbacks.</h3>
<p>Our particle system is quite powerful, thanks to our graphics engineer. Thanks to the tool, our gameplay programmer was able to add lots of feedbacks and
particles to the game. To the point where it's too much. I think that is good in any game. Feedback and adding juice to the gameplay is equally important
to the gameplay experience. And here I would like to thank our gameplay programmers for making the game so juicy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is my first 3D game (without commercial engine) that I can proudly say that I completed. Though the game could have been better, I am glad that we
did what we can and finished up the game. The whole journey is not wasted, we can always learn something from this current projects. I hope that with the
current experience and knowledge, we would not make the same kind of mistakes again, in regards to engineering to game design decisions. With that, I hope
that everybody will enjoy the game. You can check out the game at the DigiPen games gallery and I will be posting a trailer and pictures soon. Stay tuned.</p>

    <div><p>It's been a while since my last blog post. The other day, I suddenly had an idea that struck me and I thought I would like to
turn this idea into a game. So the game I want to make next is this. It is bascially a game about making choices and how sometimes
we do not obey the choices we make. I was thinking about how people always go back on their words when they promise to something
and I thought why not make a game about that.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the game is simple, it will start with a yes/no choice question. For example, do you like candies? If the player
answers yes, I will present a scenario that player will have to throw the candies away rather than keeping them and likewise for the
other choice. This way, when the game ends, I will show remind the player that the (original) choice they had make and the (actual) choice
that they executed is different.</p>
<p>I just want to show people that people usually promise things and not follow through. We are always fickle minded and we don't always
know what we want.</p>
<p>This would be the game idea for now. Until next time.</p></div>

    <div><p>I wanted to build my Resume and I was thinking of the right tool for the job. When it comes to making a resume, I can think
of the usual tools like Microsoft Word, Latex or any word processing tools for that matter. I was not so keen on using a word
processing tool for the job. I was feeling a little creative and I thought, why not create it using the tool that I am familiar with.</p>
<p>For those that do not know me, I use Inkscape and Aseprite in my own free time and I am rather familiar with both tools. I decided to
try making my own resume with Inkscape. For those who have no idea, Inkscape is a vector art drawing program. I found a template for a
resume that I liked from the internet and I tried to design my resume based on that template.</p>
<p>The resume was done in about 2 hours and I really like the end result. I sent it to my career advisor and one of the feedbacks I got was
the resume needs clickable url links especially to my website and/or my email. I decided that, well adding a link would not be that hard
right? I was wrong, inkscape have no easy way to have clickable links. I did some research and I found a rather simple way to do that.</p>
<p>The most simplest way that I found was using a web browser to export the svg files that is created by Inkscape. I have tried this on
firefox and chrome and it works.</p>
<p>Below is the instructions to create your own clickable links.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Create a text/url that you want to display.</p></li>
<li><p>Group the text/url. (This is a shortcut to make the text into an object for the next step).</p></li>
<li><p>Right click on the object that you want to have a clickable link, select "Create Link".</p></li>
<li><p>Inkscape will have a new panel, input the link to open inside the href field.</p></li>
<li><p>Done. Save the file as an svg.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the svg file in a web browser (tested on firefox and chrome) and click print.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to print to file and the file will be in a .pdf format.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This are the steps that I did to create clickable urls in Inkscape. I have included a test.svg file to try.</p>
<p>TL;DR Save file as .svg, open with browser and print to file.</p></div>

    <div><p>Previously I had only talked about the memory bugs in our game. This post is about the other kind of bugs that we had squashed. The most common issue that we faced in the past few weeks(because we were rushing for submission) were XML issues, untested APIs and lots of logic issue. Our engine only had a simple serialization/deserialization/property system and so this led to multiple issues. Of which the common ones that we faced were because of the file merging issue. When we merge our level files, the merge sometimes didn't merge properly which causes our xml file to be out of date than the other person's. The solution that we came up with to circumvent that was to have our scene objects load from our prefab file if a prefab was specified. That way we can modify the prefab and not affect the scene at all.</p>
<p>Other bugs that we encountered is untested API which is very common for us because when we were writing the components, usually we are the ones that will use the API. This in turn causes our API to not be thoroughly tested as it is. A few example of bugs like this was the changing scene and sound API bug. The former is when the engine invokes a scene change, it will crash and the latter involving sound was not heavily used and tested therefore a few bugs in the sound system.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we also have bugs with our Math quaternion library and rotations. Initially we do not really understand about quaternions but as we incorporated it, we realized that rotations is not that simple and we have to see what is the order of the rotation and every method is different from each other. With that I will conclude this posts. Hopefully we can get to work on other new stuff for the upcoming GAM 350.</p></div>

    <div><p>Previously I had talked about fixing memory bugs with Visual Studio. Running our game in Debug mode in Visual Studio 2015 is utterly slow. Our game runs about ~10 FPS in debug mode. Why is it so slow, you may ask, well there are numerous reason for the that kind of speed and what kind of operations that you are doing. For one, Debug mode will run assert code and it will check iterators which makes it slow especially when using the STL. I am still looking for a viable alternative for STL for game dev. I think that the STL might be good for general purpose programming but it definitely is not suitable for game dev.</p>
<p>This post is not to discuss the STL, maybe I will leave that to a future post. I was experimenting and getting EASTL to work but I had no such luck. Today I will mention something that I came across a few days ago, [Microsoft]</p>
<p>Thankfully there was this article by <a class="reference external" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fsk896zz.aspx">Microsoft</a> that describes how to debug a release build which is very useful for us. Apart from that there is the checked iterator business that I mentioned which might make it faster. After I followed the guide, my FastDebug(what I named my new mode) build ran about the same speed as my release build but with the added functionality of being able to debug it.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone might find this useful for their Visual Studio debugging.</p></div>

    <div><p>In this post, I will be talking about the different types of bugs that we faced when we were developing
for our new game The Last Defender. The Last Defender is a first person/tower defense hybrid game where
player controls a drone and build towers around a base to prevent enemies from destroying the points of interest.</p>
<p>Usually in games, there are bugs and depending on the severity of the bugs, we will decide to fix it or not. Currently
the game is not completed yet. We are only at the engine building stage of the game. I will talk about the kind of bugs that
we encountered throughout the development cycle. Before we talk about the kinds of bugs that we faced, I would like to share
a little about our engine architecture (this would be useful as to why we encountered the types of bugs that we did).</p>
<p>Our engine is structured in a component based architecture, at the bottom of the layer we have a system layer which have the
platform dependent code and our engine state management build on top of that. The bugs that we faced here are usually logic error
where we had to deal with window losing/gaining focus and pausing properly when we do that. On top of that, our engine is running a
state machine internally. The different states are scene changing state, playing, paused state and loading. Our engine will listen
for messages related to this different state change and do the corresponding update accordingly. This engine portion is actually
what we often refer to as the game state manager. On top of the state managers, we have all the managers(systems) for the different
components. For our engine, we have 2 types of components. The system level components and scripts. System level components
comprises of transform, graphics, text, sound and so on. While scripts are game logic components and there all reside under the
logic system.</p>
<p>Our system level managers are responsible for managing the components within them. When we update the systems, we are updating
all the components at once. Initially, our systems all held a vector of components inside and we will update through that vector.
This could work for games where items are cleared and recreated every scene and objects are not removed at any point throughout the
gameplay. We had thought that if we were to be using just vectors to manage and store our items, we will eventually run into some
issue when our game becomes bigger. Therefore one of my classmate went ahead and created the handles for our objects. Our biggest
issue with using pointers is that if the item is removed but still pointing to the vector, the pointer will still be valid.
Therefore we tried to eliminate that kind of issue.</p>
<p>Recently we were having weird issues with our game, it will randomly crash at places where we have no idea why. We suspect it was a
memory bug and memory bugs are hard to fix. Our game were running in release mode in visual studio and that enabled our game to run
at 60fps however we could not debug the underlying symbols. It turns out that, it was the problem with our handles, don't get me wrong, our handles were working properly up until now that was. For the past few days, we kept adding content to our game that something broke our game and we had to figure out what. It turns out to be the amount of memory allocated for our handles was less than the amount of objects in our scene. That took us about two hours or so to fix. Memory bugs are easier to debug when using an memory allocator.</p>
<p>Another memory bug that we ran into was with the physics manager. The physics manager was written by me with reference to Randy
Gaul's <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/RandyGaul/ImpulseEngine">Impulse Engine</a>. The physics engine was experiencing some weird behavior, some of which was when we were spawning bullets,
the physics seems to have issues with the collision and movement. When we shoot bullets, some of the bullets seems to move in the
wrong direction. Initially I thought it was because of the way I had architect the manager because I was trying a new approach of
laying out my data. More on that in a separate post. Turns out, the collision info was corrupted because I was using a pointer for
the colliders and I had tried to have my own pooling using a simple array and a swap-with-back strategy. Turn out, it was reusing
the colliders for some of the physics components and thus causing the physics computation to be wrong. Since then I had fixed that
to use a proper object pool implementation.</p>
<p>In the next post, I will talk about other kinds of bugs that we had to fix in game.</p></div>

    <div><p>Happy New Year to everybody. I will kick start this year with a posts regarding what I want to do in this year and for the many years
to come. 2016 had been an eventful year for me, I learnt to build my own game (engine) from scratch, and I learnt numerous stuff like embedding
mono and DLL reloading.</p>
<p>This year, I am hoping to learn more about the graphics pipeline and currently I am working on my own renderer based on
OpenGL. There are a few things on my todo list, like learning Rust, Vulkan, making my own Text Editor, Compiler, the latter two hopefully in the
near future.</p>
<p>In this post I will talk briefly about what I am working on, namely my own GL renderer for my own game engine. I am creating another game engine
from scratch, hopefully enough to prototype my next game idea. I have a rough idea of how my new game will be like. I am thinking of making a top
down multiplayer game. The game would be fast paced competitive and cartoony. I will prototype out the game idea hopefully in the next couple of
weeks.</p></div>

    <div><p>This is the latest game that I have been working on for my school project (GAM 300). We are supposed to make a 3D game
from a custom game engine that we build on our own. We had submitted the first playable in the engine and now I will talk
about how it went for this project. This project is my first time building a 3D game from scratch. As with the previous project
I worked on the tools and editor for the game.</p>
<p>So what went wrong for this project? There are a lot of problems that we faced as a team, firstly our team was too big. In a
typical school project 6-8 people is the optimal however our team size is 10. Not saying that 10 is a lot but we had no prior
experience in working in a big team and we had to coordinate whos working on what. Besides that, because our team is big, the
expectations are naturally higher. Initially we had a very big idea because we thought that it would be possible for a big
team like ours to pull it off however I think we bite off more than we can chew and we had to keep taking away mechanics until
the game was nothing like the original concept.</p>
<p>Another issue with cutting away mechanics is prototyping. When we change the mechanics, we didn't really test out the mechanics
before we implement it. And because we constantly change our game ideas and mechanics, our game becomes a mess. Meanwhile over at
the technical side, we are also facing a lot of issues with the game engine. Our team chose to use the multicore engine provided
to us which was not exactly production ready and have a lot of issues.</p>
<p>We were quite inexperienced with multi core engine and thus we often make mistakes and assumed something and tons of bugs happened
in the engine which leads to a very slow development. Contributing to the slow development is the tools, I think that as a tools
programmer I have to make a good assets pipeline for the designers and developers to use however the pipeline is a mess right now.</p>
<p>Apart from that our game engine currently uses something called the HTN which is a hierarchy task network which is like a behavior
tree but more powerful. This is not a bad thing however I think that it adds unnecessary complexity to our game logic. Initially
the plan was to make the HTN accessible to the designers so that they can use it to create the AI in the game however as of late,
only we are using it. Therefore I think that we can do away with the unnecessary complexity and just code the game logic.</p>
<p>Now, on to the things that went right. Definitely multi core! I feel that multi core is the way to go and we as programmer don't
tend to think of things in parallel. In fact the real world is parallel and so we need to think in terms of multi core. Programming
with a multi core engine has let me to learn a lot.</p>
<p>Our current plans is to discard the original game idea and continue with a new game idea because we want to focus and make something
fun. As for the technical side, we are intending to rewrite the game engine from scratch (hopefully we have time).</p></div>
